Please see the [Ionic Native documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/) for complete instructions on how to add and use the plugins.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor the full Ionic Native documentation, please visit [https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/).\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nTo use a plugin, import and add the plugin provider to your `@NgModule`, and then inject it where you wish to use it.\n\n```typescript\n// app.module.ts\nimport { Camera } from '@ionic-native/camera';\n\n...\n\n@NgModule({\n  ...\n\n  providers: [\n    ...\n    Camera\n    ...\n  ]\n  ...\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```\n\n```typescript\nimport { Geolocation } from '@ionic-native/geolocation';\nimport { Platform } from 'ionic-angular';\n\nimport { NgZone } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({ ... })\nexport class MyComponent {\n\n  constructor(private geolocation: Geolocation, private platform: Platform, private ngZone: NgZone) {\n\n    platform.ready().then(() => {\n\n      // get position\n      geolocation.getCurrentPosition().then(pos => {\n\n        console.log(`lat: ${pos.coords.latitude}, lon: ${pos.coords.longitude}`)\n\n      });\n\n\n      // watch position\n      const watch = geolocation.watchPosition().subscribe(pos => {\n\n        console.log(`lat: ${pos.coords.latitude}, lon: ${pos.coords.longitude}`)\n\n        // Currently, observables from Ionic Native plugins\n        // need to run inside of zone to trigger change detection\n        ngZone.run(() => {\n          this.position = pos;\n        })\n\n      });\n\n      // to stop watching\n      watch.unsubscribe();\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n}\n```\n\n### Mocking and Browser Development\n\nIonic Native 3.x makes it possible to mock plugins and develop nearly the entirety of your app in the browser or in `ionic serve`.\n\nTo do this, you need to provide a mock implementation of the plugins you wish to use. Here's an example of mocking the `Camera` plugin to return a stock image while in development:\n\nFirst import the `Camera` class in your `src/app/app.module.ts` file:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Camera } from '@ionic-native/camera';\n```\n\nThen create a new class that extends the `Camera` class with a mock implementation:\n\n```typescript\nclass CameraMock extends Camera {\n  getPicture(options) {\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n      resolve(\"BASE_64_ENCODED_DATA_GOES_HERE\");\n    })\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, override the previous `Camera` class in your `providers` for this module:\n\n```typescript\nproviders: [\n  { provide: Camera, useClass: CameraMock }\n]\n```\n\nHere's the full example:\n\n```typescript\nimport { NgModule, ErrorHandler } from '@angular/core';\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { IonicApp, IonicModule, IonicErrorHandler } from 'ionic-angular';\nimport { MyApp } from './app.component';\nimport { HomePage } from '../pages/home/home';\n\nimport { Camera } from '@ionic-native/camera';\n\nclass CameraMock extends Camera {\n  getPicture(options) {\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n      resolve(\"BASE_64_ENCODED_DATA_GOES_HERE\");\n    })\n  }\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    MyApp,\n    HomePage\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp)\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [IonicApp],\n  entryComponents: [\n    MyApp,\n    HomePage\n  ],\n  providers: [\n    {provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: IonicErrorHandler},\n    { provide: Camera, useClass: CameraMock }\n  ]\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\n```\n\n\n### Runtime Diagnostics\n\nSpent way too long diagnosing an issue only to realize a plugin wasn't firing or installed? Ionic Native lets you know what the issue is and how you can resolve it.\n\n![img](https://ionic-io-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ionic-native-console.png)\n\n\n## Plugin Missing?\nLet us know or submit a PR! Take a look at [the Developer Guide](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md) for more on how to contribute. :heart:\n\n## Ionic V1/Angular 1 support\n\nFor Ionic V1/Angular 1 support, please use version 2 of Ionic Native. See the [2.x README](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/blob/8cd648db5cddd7bdbe2bd78839b19c620cc8c04c/README.md) for usage information.\n\n# Credits\n\nIbby Hadeed - [@ihadeed](https://github.com/ihadeed)\n\nTim Lancina - [@timlancina](https://twitter.com/timlancina)\n\nMike Hartington - [@mhartington](https://twitter.com/mhartington)\n\nMax Lynch - [@maxlynch](https://twitter.com/maxlynch)\n\nRob Wormald - [@robwormald](https://twitter.com/robwormald)"

The CordovaError class is inherited from Error, so CordovaError instances is also valid Error instances (`instanceof` check succeeds).\n\nUsage:\n\n```js\nvar CordovaError = require('cordova-common').CordovaError;\nthrow new CordovaError('Some error message', SOME_ERR_CODE);\n```\n\nSee [CordovaError](src/CordovaError/CordovaError.js) for supported error codes.\n\n### `ConfigParser`\n\nExposes functionality to deal with cordova project `config.xml` files. For ConfigParser API reference check [ConfigParser Readme](src/ConfigParser/README.md).\n\nUsage:\n```js\nvar ConfigParser = require('cordova-common').ConfigParser;\nvar appConfig = new ConfigParser('path/to/cordova-app/config.xml');\nconsole.log(appconfig.name() + ':' + appConfig.version());\n```\n\n### `PluginInfoProvider` and `PluginInfo`\n\n`PluginInfo` is a wrapper for cordova plugins' `plugin.xml` files. This class may be instantiated directly or via `PluginInfoProvider`.

The CordovaError class is inherited from Error, so CordovaError instances is also valid Error instances (`instanceof` check succeeds).\n\nUsage:\n\n```js\nvar CordovaError = require('cordova-common').CordovaError;\nthrow new CordovaError('Some error message', SOME_ERR_CODE);\n```\n\nSee [CordovaError](src/CordovaError/CordovaError.js) for supported error codes.\n\n### `ConfigParser`\n\nExposes functionality to deal with cordova project `config.xml` files. For ConfigParser API reference check [ConfigParser Readme](src/ConfigParser/README.md).\n\nUsage:\n```js\nvar ConfigParser = require('cordova-common').ConfigParser;\nvar appConfig = new ConfigParser('path/to/cordova-app/config.xml');\nconsole.log(appconfig.name() + ':' + appConfig.version());\n```\n\n### `PluginInfoProvider` and `PluginInfo`\n\n`PluginInfo` is a wrapper for cordova plugins' `plugin.xml` files. This class may be instantiated directly or via `PluginInfoProvider`. The difference is that `PluginInfoProvider` caches `PluginInfo` instances based on plugin source directory.\n\nUsage:\n```js\nvar PluginInfo: require('cordova-common').PluginInfo;\nvar PluginInfoProvider: require('cordova-common').PluginInfoProvider;\n\n// The following instances are equal\nvar plugin1 = new PluginInfo('path/to/plugin_directory');\nvar plugin2 = new PluginInfoProvider().get('path/to/plugin_directory');\n\nconsole.log('The plugin ' + plugin1.id + ' has version ' + plugin1.version)\n```\n\n### `ActionStack`\n\nUtility module for dealing with sequential tasks.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

We then take the most significant digit.\n\n**Example:** 4001.3001.0000-dev-harmony-fb aligns with 1.1.0-dev-harmony (aka 001.001.000-dev-harmony) in upstream, with our own changes on top.\n\nEsprima-FB serves as a **building block** for JSX language tools and transpiler implementations (such as [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) or [JSXDOM](https://github.com/vjeux/jsxdom)).\n\nEsprima-FB runs on many popular web browsers, as well as other ECMAScript platforms such as\n[Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino) and [Node.js](https://npmjs.org/package/esprima).\n\nFor more information on original Esprima, check the web site [esprima.org](http://esprima.org)."

The recursive walk is a\npre-traversal, so children get called before their parents.\n\nPerforming a pre-traversal makes it easier to write nested transforms since\ntransforming parents often requires transforming all its children first.\n\nThe return value is string-like (it defines `.toString()` and `.inspect()`) so\nthat you can call `node.update()` asynchronously after the function has\nreturned and still capture the output.\n\nInstead of passing a `src` you can also use `opts.source`.\n\nAll of the `opts` will be passed directly to\n[acorn](https://npmjs.org/package/acorn).\n\n## custom parser\n\nYou may pass in an instance of acorn to the opts as `opts.parser` to use that\nversion instead of the version of acorn packaged with this library.\n\n```js\nvar acorn = require('acorn-jsx');\n\nfalafel(src, {parser: acorn, plugins: { jsx: true }}, function(node) {\n  // this will parse jsx\n});\n```\n\n# nodes\n\nAside from the regular [esprima](http://esprima.org) data, you can also call\nsome inserted methods on nodes.\n\nAside from updating the current node, you can also reach into sub-nodes to call\nupdate functions on children from parent nodes.\n\n## node.source()\n\nReturn the source for the given node, including any modifications made to\nchildren nodes.\n\n## node.update(s)\n\nTransform the source for the present node to the string `s`.\n\nNote that in `'ForStatement'` node types, there is an existing subnode called\n`update`. For those nodes all the properties are copied over onto the\n`node.update()` function.\n\n## node.parent\n\nReference to the parent element or `null` at the root element.\n\n# install\n\nWith [npm](http://npmjs.org) do:\n\n```\nnpm install falafel\n```\n\n# license\n\nMIT"

The Javascript sources are meant to be used by a bundler such as Webpack, SystemJS Builder, or Browserify. The type definitions provide support to Typescript tooling for things like type checking and code completion.\n\nUsually, the only import required by the user is `ionic-angular`, as everything from Ionic is exported by the package:\n\n```\n  import { App, NavController } from 'ionic-angular';\n```\n\n### Bundles\n\nMinified and unminified CommonJS and System.register module format bundles, as well as compiled CSS stylesheets for both Ionic iOS and Material Design are located `bundles/`. The SystemJS bundle is  primarily meant to be included in a `<script>` tag for demos, tests and Javascript playgrounds like [Plunker](http://plnkr.co/).\n\n### Installation and More\n\nTo use Ionic, we recommend installing and utilizing the [Ionic CLI](http://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/installation/) which will help you create pre-configured Ionic apps.\n\nFor full instructions on using Ionic, please visit the [Ionic Documentation](http://ionicframework.com/docs/)"

The exclamation mark can also mark text as comments.\n\twebsite = http://en.wikipedia.org/\n\tlanguage = English\n\t# The backslash below tells the application to continue reading\n\t# the value onto the next line.\n\tmessage = Welcome to \\\n\t          Wikipedia!\n\t# Add spaces to the key\n\tkey\\ with\\ spaces = This is the value that could be looked up with the key \"key with spaces\".\n\t# Unicode\n\ttab : \\u0009\n*(taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties#Format))*\n\nCurrently works with any version of node.js.\n\n## The API\n\n- `parse(text)`: Parses `text` into key-value pairs.  Returns an object containing the key-value pairs.\n- `read(path[, callback])`: Opens the file specified by `path` and calls `parse` on its content.  If the optional `callback` parameter is provided, the result is then passed to it as the second parameter.  If an error occurs, the error object is passed to `callback` as the first parameter. If `callback` is not provided, the file specified by `path` is synchronously read and calls `parse` on its contents.  The resulting object is immediately returned.\n- `createEditor([path[, callback]])`:  If neither `path` or `callback` are provided an empty editor object is returned synchronously.  If only `path` is provided, the file specified by `path` is synchronously read and parsed.  An editor object with the results in then immediately returned.  If both `path` and `callback` are provided, the file specified by `path` is read and parsed asynchronously.  An editor object with the results are then passed to `callback` as the second parameters.  If an error occurs, the error object is passed to `callback` as the first parameter.\n- `Editor`: The editor object is returned by `createEditor`.  Has the following API:\n\t- `get(key)`: Returns the value currently associated with `key`.\n\t- `set(key, [value[, comment]])`: Associates `key` with `value`. An optional comment can be provided. If `value` is not specified or is `null`, then `key` is unset.\n\t- `unset(key)`: Unsets the specified `key`.\n\t- `save([path][, callback]])`: Writes the current contents of this editor object to a file specified by `path`.  If `path` is not provided, then it'll be defaulted to the `path` value passed to `createEditor`.  The `callback` parameter is called when the file has been written to disk.\n\t- `addHeadComment`: Added a comment to the head of the file.\n\t- `toString`: Returns the string representation of this properties editor object.  This string will be written to a file if `save` is called.\n\n## Getting node-properties-parser\n\nThe easiest way to get node-properties-parser is with [npm](http://npmjs.org/):\n\n\tnpm install properties-parser\n\nAlternatively you can clone this git repository:\n\n\tgit://github.com/xavi-/node-properties-parser.git\n\n## Developed by\n* Xavi Ramirez\n\n## License\nThis project is released under [The MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)."

The initial size of the Buffer and the amount in which it grows can be configured in the constructor.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar myWritableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.WritableStreamBuffer({\r\n\tinitialSize: (100 * 1024),\t\t// start as 100 kilobytes.\r\n\tincrementAmount: (10 * 1024)\t// grow by 10 kilobytes each time buffer overflows.\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default initial size and increment amount are stored in the following constants:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_INITIAL_SIZE \t\t// (8 * 1024)\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_INCREMENT_AMOUNT\t// (8 * 1024)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWriting is standard Stream stuff:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(myBuffer);\r\n// - or -\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"\\u00bd + \\u00bc = \\u00be\", \"utf8\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can query the size of the data being held in the Buffer, and also how big the Buffer's max capacity currently is: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"ASDF\");\r\nstreamBuffers.size();\t\t\t// 4.\r\nstreamBuffers.maxSize();\t\t// Whatever was configured as initial size. In our example: (100 * 1024).\r\n```\r\n\r\nRetrieving the contents of the Buffer is simple:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();\t\t\t\t\t// Gets all held data as a Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString(\"utf8\");\t\t// Gets all held data as a utf8 string.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents(5);\t\t\t\t\t// Gets first 5 bytes as a Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString(\"utf8\", 5);\t// Gets first 5 bytes as a utf8 string.\r\n```\r\n\r\nCare should be taken when getting encoded strings from WritableStream, as it doesn't really care about the contents (multi-byte characters will not be respected).\r\n \r\nDestroying or ending the WritableStream will not delete the contents of Buffer, but will disallow any further writes:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"ASDF\");\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.destroy();\r\n\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();\t\t// Returns ASDF in Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"Yeah?\");\t\t// No effect.\r\n```\t\r\n\r\n### Readable StreamBuffer\r\n\r\nReadable Stream Buffers can have data inserted in them, which will then be pumped out via standard readable stream data events. The data to be sent out is held in a Buffer, which can grow in much the same way as a WritableStream Buffer does, if data is being put in Buffer faster than it's being pumped out. \r\n\r\nThe frequency in which chunks are pumped out, and the size of the chunks themselves can be configured in the constructor. The initial size and increment amount of internal Buffer can be configured too.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar myReadableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.ReadableStreamBuffer({\r\n\tfrequency: 10,\t\t// in milliseconds.\r\n\tchunkSize: 2048\t\t// in bytes.\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nDefault frequency and chunk size:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE \t\t// (1024)\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_FREQUENCY\t\t\t// (1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPutting data in Buffer to be pumped out is easy:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(aBuffer);\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(\"A String\", \"utf8\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nChunks are pumped out via standard readable stream spec: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.on(\"data\", function(data) {\r\n\t// Yup.\r\n\tassert.isTrue(data instanceof Buffer);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nChunks are pumped out by the interval that you specified in frequency. Setting the frequency to 0 will immediately stream the data (also in chunks), even if the stream has not been piped to a destination. This is useful for unit testing. \r\n\r\nsetEncoding() for streams is respected too:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.setEncoding(\"utf8\");\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.on(\"data\", function(data) {\r\n\tassert.isTrue(data instanceof String);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nPause and resume are also implemented. pause()'ing stream will allow buffer to continue accumulating, but will not pump any of that data out until it is resume()'d again. \r\n\r\nDestroying the stream will immediately purge the buffer, unless destroySoon() is called, in which case the rest of the buffer will be written out. Either way, any further attempts to put data in the Buffer will be silently ignored. \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.destroySoon();\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(\"A String!\");\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.size();\t\t\t// will be 0.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\nNot supposed to be a speed demon, it's more for tests/debugging or weird edge cases. It works with an internal buffer that it copies contents to/from/around.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nThanks to the following people for taking some time to contribute to this project.\r\n\r\n * Igor Dralyuk <idralyuk@ebay.com>\r\n * Simon Koudijs <simon.koudijs@intellifi.nl>\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nnode-stream-buffer is free and unencumbered public domain software.

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n5.
