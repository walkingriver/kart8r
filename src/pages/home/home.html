    This application is a totally unauthorized add-on for the very popular Mario Kart 8 by Nintendo for the Wii U&trade;.
  </p>
  <p>The app came about because my family plays Mario Kart for hours at a time. However, after a while, we discovered that each
    of us tended to favor the same character and kart combination.</p>
  <p>
    So we started by throwing dice for each player, kart, tire, and wing combination. It took awhile, and it's hard to find 18-sided
    dice. We had to come up with something a little simpler. One day my son suggested that it would make a great mobile app.
    So I sat down and created this.
  </p>
  <p>While I believe I have not infringed on any copyrights or violated any trademarks, there is always the potential that Nintendo
    could come in an shut this app down.</p>
